      <p>Hello, traveler! Welcome to my universe! Let me introduce my world to you.

      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I'm Yelyzaveta, but you can call me Elya. My hometown is Dnepr - beautiful city combines
        fast-growing industrial areas with freshness of parks and breathtaking views over the river.
        In 2019 I left my hometown to begin a journey of reinventing myself in a big world.
        I traveled to Canada to take a first step in my career - start a Computer Science Coop Bachelor program
        at Brock University. Getting accustomed to new culture and keeping up with academic deadlines while living alone
        for the first time was a tough challenge but I will always be grateful for this experience as it made more
        dedicated than ever. As my graduation looms, I reflect on a path marked by intellectual growth and professional refinement. I have completed several coop work terms enriching my knowledge and sharpening my skills while also greatly expanding my network with brilliant people. However, I could not settle at this and wanted to diversify my journey even more by becoming a research and later teaching assistant at my university. All that not only gave me pricelessly valuable knowledge and skills, but it was simply fun and fulfilling. I was looking forward each day to see how I can advance my research, or what cool feature can I add to my project, or how can I engage students into learning a new concept. As I am approaching my graduation and my time at Brock University is about to end, this is only the beginning of my journey, and I cannot wait to see where it will bring me.

      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>
        Over the years of the existance of this universe, experience planet have developed greatly. By participating in a coop program, I was given a truly lifechanging opportunity to gain valuable work experience at the same time with completing my degree. It was sometimes surprising to me how these too seemingly distant worlds of industry and academia are so consistent and balanced. I could see how useful certain theoretical concepts are for optimization of a real-life projects and at the same time the involvement in a large-scale system with contribution from many highly experienced and skilled developers enriched my knowledge and showed me realistic examples of the concepts I have learned. In each role I looked for ways to learn as much as possible and to provide the best value out of my own skills, and based on employers’ feedback I believe I was successful. Almost every time I would go above my job responsibilities just to utilize my time to the most potential like my contribution to Artificial Intelligence lab in Ministry of Transportation. Therefore, this is not just a description of my past jobs' responsibilities, this is a summary of my real personal contribution that I worked really hard on.

        the things I'd like to share. 
        </br>These projects and awards are demonstration of my skills, qualification, and passion that

      <h1>Inspiration</h1>
      <p>This is my inspiration planet. Here I plant the seeds of my interests to grow into passion trees to burn the
        wood for the fire of my enthusiasm.
        <br />My passion for coding started in IT classes back in high school. My teacher not only introduced me to
        programming but demonstrated how fun and cool it is that sparked a lifelong fascination. I made my first video game in grade 8 and it felt like a
        discovery of a new life-form in space. It was simple and not that good looking but having the result of my hard
        work for month that I could share and play myself was the greatest reward.
        <br />As long as I can remember I was always mesmerised by the unknown of space so there is no surprised that my
        favourite genre is science fiction. I especially enjoy The Martian Chronicles and short stories by Ray Bradbury.
        <br />I can't go without mentioning my heartwarming creative outlet - dancing. I have been perfecting this art
        for years - professionally and as hobby. It goes without saying that music has a big impact on me too.
