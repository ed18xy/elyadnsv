      <h1>About me</h1>
      My name is Yelyzaveta Denysova and I am a Computer Science graduate, passionate developer and AI enthusiast. I have expertise in Web Technologies having intrusted labs at university and obtained hands-on experience in full-stack development at the Ministry of Transportation. I am also interested in AI research and development, currently working on a publication based on my year-long research presented earlier at the Canadian Operational Research Society conference. When I just started my Bachelor of Mathematics and Science program at Brock University, I was only taking my first steps in a broad field of technology.

            Through a number of courses, research projects and work experience I have discovered my two main areas of interest: Web Technology and Artificial Intelligence. I decided to pursue my passion and took additional courses focusing on Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing and more earning a degree concentration in Intelligent Systems. Additionally, I have completed a Web Development Contract for the physics department and taught labs for the Internet Technology class sharpening my web development skills as well as my leadership and communication abilities. The highlight of my AI research work was my presentation at the CORS conference, which was a truly wonderful experience where I got to meet lots of fascinating people, see their delightful presentations and just get to know the community of passionate researchers.

      <p>To avoid costs of travelling across all the moonskills and planetfolios, I organized a list of
        the things I'd like to share.
        </br>These projects and awards are demonstration of my skills, qualification, and passion that
        speak louder than any words.
      </br>I am also very pleased to include feedbacks from my past employers and students, as their kind words give
        me more motivation and perhaps can paint a better picture of myself to you from other perspectives.

      <h1>Inspiration</h1>
      This is my inspiration planet. Here I plant the seeds of my interests to grow into passion trees to burn the
        wood for the fire of my enthusiasm.
        <br />My passion for coding started in IT classes back in high school. My teacher not only introduced me to
        programming but demonstrated how fun and cool it is that sparked a lifelong fascination. I made my first video
        game in grade 8 and it felt like a
        discovery of a new life-form in space. It was simple and not that good looking but having the result of my hard
        work for month that I could share and play myself was the greatest reward.

        <br />As long as I can remember I was always mesmerised by the unknown of space so there is no surprised that my
        favourite genre is science fiction. I especially enjoy The Martian Chronicles and short stories by Ray Bradbury.
        <br />I can't go without mentioning my heartwarming creative outlet - dancing. I have been perfecting this art
        for years - professionally and as hobby. It goes without saying that music has a big impact on me too.
