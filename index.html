        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>This is me. A bright sun and the creator of all energy around. </br>
          My name is Elya, and I am from a lovely but busy city Dnepr, Ukraine. 
          In 2019 I left my hometown to begin a journey of discovering myself in a big world. 
          I traveled to Canada to start a Computer Science Coop Bachelor program at Brock University. 
          Getting used to new culture and keeping up with studies while living alone for the first time 
          was a tough challenge but I will always be grateful for this experience as 
          it made more dedicated than ever. </p>

        <h1>Inspiration</h1>
        <p>This is my inspiration planet. Here I grow things that brings joy and motivation to everything I do. 
          <br/>The biggest inspiration for my programming career is my high school IT teacher. 
          Not only he introduced me to coding but showed how fun and cool it is. I made my first video game 
          in grade 8 and it felt like a discovery of a new lifeform in space. It was simple and not that good 
          looking but having something on hands, that I could actually play, after months of work was the greatest reward. 
          <br/>I was always interested in learning about universe and space but even more exciting for me is 
          to read about what <c>could</c> be in space.  Science fiction is my favourite genre and 
          I especially enjoy The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury. I like imagining what kind of life can 
          exist somewhere around us. If you're not a fan of big books, I highly recommend his collection 
          of short stories. <br/> I can't go without mentioning one of my favourite sources 
          of creative mood - dancing. It goes without saying that I love music too. </p>
